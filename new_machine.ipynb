    "\n",
    "[Simulation Factory](https://simfactory.org), or \"simfactory\" for short, is the Einstein Toolkit's tool to handle compiling Cactus on compute clusters and laptops. It also provides functionality to create and manage simualtions, and trys to provide a common interface for clusters using different resource managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the word of the simfactory authors:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    Performing large three-dimensional time-dependent simulations is a complex numerical task. Managing such simulations, often several at the same time as they execute on different supercomputers, is comparable to herding cats — supercomputers differ in their hardware configuration, available software, directory structure, queueing systems, queuing policies, and many other relevant properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these differences are only superficial, and the basic capabilities of supercomputers are very similar. The simulation factory contains a set of abstractions of the tasks which are necessary to set up and successfully finish numerical simulations using the Cactus framework. These abstractions hide tedious low-level management tasks, they capture \"best practices\" of experienced users, and they create a log trail ensuring repeatable and well-documented scientific results. Using these abstractions, many types of potentially disastrous user errors are avoided, and different supercomputers can be used in a uniform manner. \n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's simfactory is [simfactory version 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4571), a Python 3 application re-implementing the functionality of Erik Schnetter's original Perl based simfactory code."

    "### Simfactory directory structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Users typically interact with simfactory using its command line interface via the `sim` command wrapper. For example `sim build --thornlist einsteintoolkit.th etk` compiles a Cactus configuration `etk` using the thorn list file `einsteintoolkit.th`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This command is identical on all systems supported by simfactory. How then does simfactory know which compiler to use and which options to pass to the Cactus build system (and latter, how to submit a simulation to the cluster's resource manager)? \n",
    "\n",
    "Simfactory contains an extensive \"machine database\" in the `mdb` subdirectory that contains information specific to each cluster. A complete entry for a machine consistents of 4 files in subdirectories of `mdb`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a machine \"ini\" file in the `machines` subdirectory. This file uses a MS Windows [ini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) style ini syntax, to identify and describe a machine and ties all 4 files together. Options in machine ini files can be overwritten using section in the user's `etc/defs.local.ini` file in simfactory.\n",
    "* a option list file in the `optionlists` directory. This is a standard Cactus configuration file as described in chapter [B2.1](http://einsteintoolkit.org/usersguide/UsersGuide.html#x1-19000B2.1) \"Configuration Options\" of the Cactus UsersGuide\n",
    "* 2 template files, a submit sript in `submitscripts` and a run script in `runscripts`, that are used when submitting simulations to the resource manager. The former typically contains the resource manager comments (e.g. `#SBATCH -A MyAllocation`) and is the template for the batch job script passed to the resource manager. The latter, the run script, is a bash script template file that contains the \"meat\" of the batch job script.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example this is what a directory layout of files used to descripe a cluster \"foo\" could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "simfactory\n",
    "  |\n",
    "  +- mdb\n",
    "  |   |\n",
    "  |   +- machines/foo.ini\n",
    "  |   +- optionlists/foo-gnu.cfg\n",
    "  |   +- runscripts/foo-gnu.run\n",
    "  |   +- submitscripts/foo.sub\n",
    "  |\n",
    "  +- etc\n",
    "      |\n",
    "      +- defs.local.ini\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up simfactory for a new machine means providing the 4 mdb files to simfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, unfortunately, not a simple task and requires experience using clusters as well as some understanding of simfactory. In particular, setting up simfactory on a cluster is quite a bit more complex than \"only\" compiling and submitting a Cactus simulation using example batch job scripts and suggested [environment modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Modules_(software)) the cluster's help page. Simfactory does not provide any automation or help when incorporating a new machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years a number of attempts were made to document this, first in the [Simulation Factory User Guide](https://simfactory.bitbucket.io/simfactory2/userguide/) by Ian Hinder, then in the [Simulation Factory Advanced Tutorial](https://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/Simulation_Factory_Advanced_Tutorial) by Michael Thomas and Ian Hinder, and finally in the [Configuring a new machine](https://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/Configuring_a_new_machine) Einstein Toolkit wiki page by Ian Hinder and Roland Haas. All of these still provide valueable, if incomplete, sources of information that should be consulted by anyone attempting to set up simfactory on a new machine.\n",

    "## Before you start: gather information\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up simfactory is not for the faint of heart, but a lot trouble can be avoid by spending some time gathering information. Setting up simfactory is also not fast, it takes me, whom I consider to be familiar with HPC systems and who has done this before, at least half a day for an initial setup and likely a couple of months of using the setup to iron out kinks. So if you have never added a machine to simfactory, have never used the machine in question before, and this is you first time using the Einstein Toolkit, you are in for a tough ride (but is has been done) and should expect to spent multiple days. However, help is available, usually from the Einstein Toolkit users group <a href=\"mailto:users@einsteintoolkit.org\">users@einsteintoolkit.org</a> and from the cluster admins.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this out of the way, these are information would collect:\n",
    "\n",
    "* find the cluster's documentation website, e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/70549542\n",
    "  * locate information on how to log in, e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581213#QuickstartonCheyenne-LogginginonanNCARsystem\n",
    "  * locate information on what environment module system is used, e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581213#QuickstartonCheyenne-Environment You should be familiar with [environment modules](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the `module avail`, `module spider` and `module load` commands.\n",
    "  * locate information on the file systems on the cluster, you want one directory that does not purge to store source code and compile, and a scratch directory where to run simulations, e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/68878466\n",
    "  * locate information on how to compile a code which compilers to use etc., e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581213#QuickstartonCheyenne-compilingCompiling . Usually I start with the default choices made by the admins for C/C++/Fortran compiler and `MPI` library. Everything else is optional and can be ignored if needed. However you may want to take note of \"typical\" libraries for use by the ET for example `HDF5`, `GSL`, `BLAS`/`LAPACK`/`MKL`\n",
    "  * find a \"sample batch\" script, e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581213#QuickstartonCheyenne-submittingSubmittingjobs\n",
    "    * find out about which queues exist usually from the docs, e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581213#QuickstartonCheyenne-Cheyennequeues but if all else fails, and assuming the system uses SLURM, you can use the output of `scontrol show partitions` or for PBS like systems `qstat -q`.\n",
    "* download (and know how to compile and run) an MPI \"Hello, world!\" code, for example [this](https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/mpi-hello-world/) or even better [Blue Waters's](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/liferay-content/document-library/Documentation%20Documents/aprun/hello_world.c) more informative one. This will be helpful to check that the resource manager is being used correclty later on\n",

    "\n",
    "Most option are fairly straightforward to set by consulting the machine documentation pages, e.g. https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/70549542 for homepage, machine name, login hostname to use, flop counts etc. (though WikiPedia can also be a good source for this \"information only\" fields).\n",
    "\n",
    "They are all extensively documented in the ET [wiki's](https://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/Configuring_a_new_machine) \"Configuring a new machine\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "`aliaspattern` should be set to a regular expression that matches the login node hostnames for this machine (and only this machine). If you did not note it down, `./simfactory/bin/sim whoami` will show it again (until you have created the ini file). For CHeyenne a good guess is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "aliaspattern = ^cheyenne[1-9]\\cheyenne\\.ucar\\.edu$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the anchors `^` and `$` ensure that the full hostname is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are happy the ini file you can test `envsetup` and the `aliaspattern` using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> ./simfactory/bin/sim whoami\n",
    "> ./simfactory/bin/sim execute 'echo \"Hello, world!\"'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which should output the detected machine name (cheyenne) in the first line. The second line instructs simfactory to run the systems `echo` command to print \"Hello, world!\" using the `envsetup` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Cheyenne I used this to fix module conflicts between `HDF5` (which I want) and `netcdf` (loaded by default but I don't care)."
